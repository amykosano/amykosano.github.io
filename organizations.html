           <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
             Onward We Learn is a college readiness program generally aimed toward younger and first generation students. The organization impacts middle and high school studentsâ€™ education, college retainment, and college support and advising. The organization does accept volunteers from both non/school aged people to help take care of students or to provide career guidance.
           </p>
           <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> I feel that there would be more helpers available if there were advertisements about the organization. I also feel that Onward We Learn could be amazing for education and teacher internships. I would like to help increase the organization's prominence on college campuses by advertising it among college students studying to be teachers or looking to take care of kids.
           </p> 
           <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Working alongside Onward We Learn at URI, is the Talent Development program. I have amazing opportunity to help with creating a long-form promo video about the program.
