            I am a Film student at the University of Rhode Island. I specialize in camera and sound equipment, as well as using Adobe Premiere Pro to edit and polish short films. On my downtime, I walk my cats, tend to my veggie garden, or play videogames.

 <td> <strong> <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> My oldest cat is named Baron, after the Ghibli movie The Cat Returns. I adopted him from Puerto Rico and he is about 2 years old. Baron loves to cuddle, chew weird things, and peek his head from outside the shower curtains. He loves to go outside and would make sad meows until I harness him up. Sometimes when I am tending my garden, I remove grass growing too close, rinse them, and let Baron eat them from a paper plate because he is a special twerp.

     During my fall and spring 2021-2022 semesters at URI, I lived on-campus in a LLC. Every weekend I would visit my parents, so I would buy pizza, gelato, and the occassional clam chowder. Baron may be found sleeping on top of the pizza box, preventing people from eating any slices. He also did this with a birthday cake for my mother, squishing it to one side.
