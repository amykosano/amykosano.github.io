           Manifesto
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> I combine my passion for immortalizing stories and theater production by adapting them to the screen for more people to see. Not only do I work on costumes for Macbeth and Little Shop of Horrors, I also take photographs of my peers hard at work in carpentry and theater technology to help promote the live performances. Even now, as a student nearing my early graduation, I love learning new skills and meeting new people.
          </p>
          <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I love using what I know to help others. Before I interned as a wardrobe assistant for a Lifetime film, I volunteered as one of the two main developers for an hour-long audio tour soundtrack for an exhibit at the Storm King Art Center in NY. While I enjoy working as part of a team, both in-person and remotely, I am self-sufficient and able to work independently. For example, I worked remotely on my previously mentioned audio tour for 11 months and had meetings every Monday morning. I also worked remotely as a marketing intern for Saggio Technology, working with a team to create weekly comics that align with the companyâ€™s branding.

 <td> <strong> <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> My oldest cat is named Baron, after the Ghibli movie The Cat Returns. I adopted him from Puerto Rico and he is about 2 years old. Baron loves to cuddle, chew weird things, and peek his head from outside the shower curtains. He loves to go outside and would make sad meows until I harness him up. Sometimes when I am tending my garden, I remove grass growing too close, rinse them, and let Baron eat them from a paper plate because he is a special twerp.

     During my fall and spring 2021-2022 semesters at URI, I lived on-campus in a LLC. Every weekend I would visit my parents, so I would buy pizza, gelato, and the occassional clam chowder. Baron may be found sleeping on top of the pizza box, preventing people from eating any slices. He also did this with a birthday cake for my mother, squishing it to one side.
