         <strong> <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I am a Film student at the University of Rhode Island. I first started out as a research and development intern for PPE, collaborating with various small businesses and reaching out to ask clients' their wants. Using my knowledge from this role, as well as my expertise in Adobe Premiere and Audition, I volunteer as the main sound designer for a permanent museum exhibit, spending up to 40 hours for each weekly deadline to see this project come to fruition. I highly value working efficiently, pushing for progress, and clear communication and decision making. With my experience in digitally painting 2D assets for video games under short-development times and rendering humorous weekly artwork, I am also a rigorous 2D illustrator with a proficiency in Photoshop, After Effects, and 2D animation.

           <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> As a film student at URI, I am familiar with the process of film post/production and project planning, being able to work both in teams and independently. My current goal is to get a head-start in my search for a career in film/video production. Due to my excitement to work, I earned a spot on the Dean's List several times and am graduating a year early from my university.
